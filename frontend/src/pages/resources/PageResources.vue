    <p>Resources and tools central to Monarch Initiative.</p>
    <p>
      The Monarch Initiative is an international consortium that leads key
      global standards and semantic data integration technologies. Monarch
      resources and integrated data are also foundational to many downstream
      applications and contexts; we work closely with a variety of stakeholders
      and resource-development communities to capture feedback and make
      improvements. To maximize utility and impact, the Monarch platform is
      composed of multiple open-source, open-access components. We promote
      provenance and transparency, enhanced use of standards and new
      technologies and improved data accessibility, end-user utility, and data
      submission. Below, we highlight a collection of our flagship projects.

    <p>
      The Monarch Initiative is developing a suite of AI tools to help
      researchers and clinicians make sense of the vast amount of data available
      in the Monarch ecosystem. These tools include machine learning models,
      embeddings, and other AI techniques to help with data integration, data
      analysis, and data interpretation.
