        Understanding genomic variation is key to precision medicine; however,
        despite the ease of sequencing, clinical interpretation is still
        thwarted because available variant-phenotype association data is
        complex, heterogeneous, and disaggregated across sources. Moreover, this
        evidence is sometimes incomplete, conflicting, and erroneous.
        Consequently, clinicians face long lists of candidate diseases, genes,
        and countless variants of unknown significance. Indeed, the efficiency
        and affordability of sequencing data has shifted the bottleneck to
        interpretation, based largely on these phenotype resources.
        <br /><br />
        The Monarch Initiative is developing a community Phenomics-First
        Resource (PFR) to advance the emerging field of phenomics; its initial
        focus will be improving the phenotype data that supports variant
        prioritization in genetic disease diagnosis. Our approach is modeled on
        the Gene Ontology (GO). GO is the standard for describing gene function,
        and it benefits from active community use and development. The PFR will
        provide an overarching complementary solution for phenotypesâ€”the
        higher-level outcomes of gene function/dysfunction. Our approach
        acknowledges the complexity of phenomics: currently, curated phenotype
        data is scattered across multiple databases with different standards
        (exchange formats, database schemas, and ontologies). More than 100
        organizations curate human diseases and their attributes (phenotypes,
        genes, variants, frequency, treatments, etc.); dozens more curate model
        organism phenotypes. <br /><br />
        The PFR will provide a framework to fundamentally advance and simplify
        computational approaches for interpreting human genome variation. We are
        the creators of the Human Phenotype Ontology which has been the
        cornerstone of our pioneering work in data integration. We will leverage
        this to align phenotype ontologies and clinical terminologies, bringing
        major model species and clinical domains into the PFR, which we will
        refine through continual community partnership. We propose the following
        interlinked approaches that will provide a dynamic suite of
        community-developed knowledge resources to revolutionize variant
        interpretation applications and drive precision medicine.

        The Phenomics First Resource comprises 3 major sub-components which are
        integrated into a common platform to transform variant interpretation
        and drive precision medicine.

    <p>
      The Unified Phenotype Ontology (uPheno) is an effort led by the Monarch
      Initiative to integrate phenotype terminologies across species. uPheno has
      to major components: an OWL ontology that imports and deeply integrates
      phenotype ontologies from a variety of species, including Human and
      several major model organisms (such as Drosophila, Zebrafish, Xenopus, C.
      elegans, and Mouse), and a library of phenotype ontology term templates
      that are developed by the
