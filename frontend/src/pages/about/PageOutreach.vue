                    <p>
                        The Mondo Outreach calls aim to bring together stakeholders and clinical terminology experts to discuss specific use cases and requirements and improve Mondo with a focus on our user needs in mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These calls are scheduled on Fridays, every four weeks. Every month we’ll invite a group to present their use case, and we’d like to learn if there is anything we can do from the Mondo technical side to improve user use cases. <br/>
                        During the call, the Mondo technical team will give an overview of the latest developments and, followed by a ~20-minute talk + discussion from specific users where we’ll discuss paths forward on how we can work together.
