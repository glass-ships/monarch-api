          >
          <p>
            Mondo aims to harmonize disease definitions across the world. The
            name Mondo comes from the latin word ‘mundus’ and means ‘for the
            world.’
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Mondo Outreach calls aim to bring together stakeholders and
              clinical terminology experts to discuss specific use cases and
              requirements. Our goal is to improve Mondo with a focus on our
              user needs.

          <p>
            LinkML is a flexible modeling language that allows you to author

          <p>
            LinkML is used to model the Monarch data model, and we welcome your
