Please keep images consistent.
Make note of file size, file format, file compression, file naming, dimensions, framing/cropping.

Members images are stared by name as first-last.jpg with no capitalization. If the file is named correctly the image will be used for the members picture. If you are having trouble getting an image to show for a member make sure that the file is named correctly, i.e. not jpeg but jpg.
